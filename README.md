# AI-Assisted Home & Building Inspection

This project uses AI to assist in detecting issues in homes and buildings like cracks, leaks, or visible damages from images and inspection notes.

## Key Features
- Classify defects in images (like cracks, leaks, etc.)
- Analyze text-based inspection reports
- Provide a simple risk score and summary of findings

## How to Run
- Clone the repository and set up your environment (steps are provided in the README).
- Train and test models for both image and text classification.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the analysis using the command: `python run_analysis.py <image_path> <text_path>`.
